# defopt-stubs

Typing stubs for the [defopt](https://github.com/anntzer/defopt) package.

These stubs provide comprehensive type hints for the runtime library, which does not
ship with annotations. The stubs cover the complete public API including all
main functions (`run`, `bind`, `bind_known`), signature inspection, and their
parameters. Contributions are welcome!

## Installation

```
pip install defopt-stubs
```
